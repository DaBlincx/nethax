This script can be used to trick people into thinking, that you are a hacker.

This is not a real hacking tool and should not be interpreted as one.

Have fun :)



# Disclaimer

this tool will scan your area for available wifi networks, so it looks legit

none of this data will be sent to anyone, it's only used by the script itself and dumped into a txt file after scanning

if you plan on adding these files to your own git repository, please add "pw_dump.txt" and "wifi_dump.txt" to .gitignore
